**Rete.js application**

## Introduction

Rete Studio is a general-purpose code generation tool powered by Rete.js. Its primary goal is to seamlessly bridge the gap between textual and visual programming languages. With Rete Studio, you can transform a textual programming language into a visual representation, which can then be transformed back into textual language.

## Key features

- **Playground**: input your code and check its graph representation
- **Lab**: debugging tool for code transformation into a graph and back
- **Editor**: open your local project to edit code visually as a graph

## Roadmap

Currently, JavaScript is the only supported language. Considering the complexity of the transformation process, our current priority is building a robust application. Once we have fine-tuned our methodologies and algorithms (including different programming languages), we will introduce them as a separate plugin for Rete.js.

**If you believe in the potential of this project to revolutionize the way code generation is approached, you can contribute to its growth through [Sponsorship](https://retejs.org/sponsor) or by making a meaningful contribution in any other way.**
